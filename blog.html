                Q1: What is difference between map(), filter(), forEach(), and find()?
            </h2>
            <p>
                <span style="background: greenyellow;">Answer:</span> In JavaScript, map(), filter(), forEach(), and
                find() are all array methods that allow you to
                perform operations on arrays in different ways. Here's a brief overview of the differences between them:
                <br>
                <br>

                <span style="font-weight: bold;">map():</span> map() is used to transform each element of an array and
                return a new array with the transformed
                values. It creates a new array with the same length as the original array, but with each element
                transformed based on a provided function.
                <br>
                <br>

                <span style="font-weight: bold;">filter():</span> filter() is used to create a new array with all
                elements that pass a provided test. It returns
                a new array that contains only the elements that meet the condition specified in the provided function.
                <br>
                <br>


                <span style="font-weight: bold;">forEach():</span> forEach() is used to iterate over an array and
                perform a specified action on each element. It
                does not return a new array but instead applies a provided function to each element in the array.
                <br>
                <br>


                <span style="font-weight: bold;">find():</span> find() is used to return the first element in an array
                that passes a provided test. It returns
                the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided function.
                <br>
                <br>


                In summary, map() and filter() both return new arrays, forEach() does not return anything, and find()
                returns a single element. Each of these methods can be useful depending on the task you're trying to
                accomplish with an array in JavaScript.

                Q2: What is difference between localStorage, sessionStorage and cookies?

            </h2>
            <p>
                <span style="background: greenyellow;">Answer:</span> localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies are all
                ways to store data on the client-side (i.e., in the user's browser), but they have some differences in
                terms of scope, capacity, and expiration.
                <br>
                <br>

                <span style="font-weight: bold;">localStorage:</span> localStorage is a web storage API that allows you
                to store key-value pairs in the browser's local storage. The data stored in localStorage persists even
                after the user closes the browser window or restarts their device, and it is available to any JavaScript
                code running on the same origin (i.e., domain name, protocol, and port number). localStorage has a
                larger capacity than cookies (usually up to 5-10 MB), and the data is not sent to the server with every
                HTTP request.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">sessionStorage:</span> sessionStorage is similar to localStorage, but
                it only stores data for the duration of the browser session. Once the user closes the browser window or
                tab, the data is deleted. Like localStorage, sessionStorage is available to any JavaScript code running
                on the same origin.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cookies:</span> Cookies are small text files that are stored on the
                client-side by a web server. Cookies have a name, a value, and optional attributes such as an expiration
                date, a domain, and a path. Cookies are sent to the server with every HTTP request, so they can be used
                to persist data across multiple pages or even across different websites. However, cookies have a smaller
                capacity than localStorage or sessionStorage (usually up to 4 KB per cookie), and they are vulnerable to
                security risks such as cross-site scripting and cross-site request forgery.

                Q3: What is event loop and how does it work?

            </h2>
            <p>
                <span style="background: greenyellow;">Answer:</span> The event loop is a key concept in JavaScript that
                allows it to be non-blocking and performant. It's a mechanism for handling asynchronous code and
                managing the execution of code in the call stack.
                <br>
                <br>

                Here's how the event loop works:
                <br>
                <br>

                JavaScript is single-threaded, which means that it can only execute one task at a time. When a
                JavaScript program is executed, it starts with an initial call to a function, which is added to the call
                stack.
                <br>
                <br>
                As the function executes, it can invoke other functions, which are added to the call stack in a
                first-in, last-out order. Each function must complete its execution before the next function in the
                stack can be executed.
                <br>
                <br>
                If a function needs to perform an asynchronous operation, such as waiting for a network request or a
                timer to complete, it can delegate that task to a browser API, which will handle it in the background.
                <br>
                <br>
                When the asynchronous operation is complete, the browser API places a corresponding event on the event
                queue.
                <br>
                <br>
                The event loop continuously monitors the call stack and the event queue. If the call stack is empty, the
                event loop will take the first event from the event queue and push it onto the call stack, which will
                execute the corresponding callback function.
                <br>
                <br>
                The callback function can then invoke other functions and add them to the call stack, and the cycle
                continues.
                <br>
                <br>
                This mechanism allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous code without blocking the main thread, which can
                make web applications feel more responsive and performant. However, it's important to understand how the
                event loop works to avoid potential pitfalls such as blocking the call stack with long-running
                operations or creating infinite loops in event handlers.
